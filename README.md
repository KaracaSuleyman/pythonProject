# Python Fundamentals & Exercises Project

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts covering fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practice exercises. It includes implementations ranging from basic data structures to advanced concepts like decorators and magic methods.

## 🛠 Project Structure
The project covers various Python topics including:
* **Core Concepts:** Loops, if-else statements, arguments (*args & **kwargs).
* **Data Structures:** Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, and List Comprehensions.
* **Functional Programming:** Lambda functions, Map, Filter, Reduce, and Zip functions.
* **Advanced Python:** Decorators, Iterators, Generators, and Magic Methods.
* **OOP:** Inheritance, Properties, and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
* **Projects:** Small games like BlackJack and Project Euler solutions.

## 📋 Project Rules

### Writing Rules
* **Code Documentation:** Comment lines must be included within the code to explain logic and flow.

### Naming Conventions
1. All names must end with their respective **type** (where applicable).
   * e.g., `calculateFunction`, `userList`, `resultText`.
2. **camelCase** is the primary naming convention for this project's variables and functions.

## 🚀 Git & GitHub Workflow

### GitHub DOs
* **Branching:** Create a new branch immediately after being added as a collaborator.
* **File Staging:** Do not use `git add .` blindly. Specify the file path.
   * *Example:* `git add decorators.py`
   * (Tip: Use "Copy Path" > "Path from Content Root" in your IDE).
* **Updates:** Run `git pull` on the **master** branch before starting any new work.
* **Merging:** Always pull the latest changes on **master**, then switch to your branch and **merge**.
* **Integrity Check:** Regularly check that you are on your feature branch and NOT on **master**.
* **Commits:** Follow the format `git commit -m "date name"`.

### GitHub DON'Ts
* **Master Branch:** Strictly no direct development on the **master** branch.
* **Communication:** Do not push updates without communicating with the team.
* **Leadership:** Consult the **Lead** before making changes to shared or core modules.
